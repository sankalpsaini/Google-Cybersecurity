Analyse Network Layer Communication


Part 1: Provide a summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP
traffic log

- Line 4, where the ICMP package was undelivered to the specific port of the DNS server
- This is shown when after the first package is sent, we receive the message “udp port 53 unreachable”
- Port 53 is usually used for DNS protocol traffic. Seems as if the system is not responding.



Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide one solution to implement

- Incident occurred at 1:24:36. It was reported by the several customers indicating an unreachable page.
- This incident is currently being investigated so that customers can reach the site again as soon as possible.
- During this investigation, it was found that UDP port 53 was unreachable, although it should commonly be reached.
- We must now figure out why it is unreachable (potentially due to the server being down or traffic is being blocked)
